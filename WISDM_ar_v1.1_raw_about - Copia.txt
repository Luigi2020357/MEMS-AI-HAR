 For WISDM's activity prediction dataset v1.1 we used the file released and provided by the Wireless Sensor Data Mining   <(WISDM) Lab. http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/>. The data in this file corrispond with the data used in the following paper:
Jennifer R. Kwapisz, Gary M. Weiss and Samuel A. Moore (2010). Activity Recognition using Cell Phone Accelerometers, Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data (at KDD-10), Washington DC. <http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/public_files/sensorKDD-2010.pdf>
When using this dataset, we request that you cite this paper.

Associated tasks: classification
Number of examples: 1,098,207
Number of attributes: 6
Missing attribute values: None
Class distribution: {
	Walking -> 424,400 -> 38.6%,
	Jogging -> 342,177 -> 31.2%,
	Upstairs -> 122,869 -> 11.2%,
	Downstairs -> 100,427 -> 9.1%,
	Sitting -> 59,939 -> 5.5%,
	Standing -> 48,395 -> 4.4% }

raw.txt follows this format:
[user],[activity],[timestamp],[x-acceleration],[y-accel],[z-accel];

This line is a representative example:
33,Jogging,49105962326000,-0.6946377,12.680544,0.50395286;

Sampling rate: 
20Hz (1 sample every 50ms)

Fields:
*user
	nominal, 1..36

*activity
	nominal, {
		Walking
		Jogging
		Sitting
		Standing
		Upstairs
		Downstairs }

*timestamp
	numeric, generally the phone's uptime in nanoseconds
		(In future datasets this will be miliseconds
		since unix epoch.)

*x-acceleration
	numeric, floating-point values between -20 .. 20
		The acceleration in the x direction as measured
		by the android phone's accelerometer. 
		A value of 10 = 1g = 9.81 m/s^2, and
		0 = no acceleration.
		The acceleration recorded includes gravitational
		acceleration toward the center of the Earth, so
		that when the phone is at rest on a flat surface
		the vertical axis will register +-10. 

*y-accel
	numeric, see x-acceleration

*z-accel
        numeric, see x-acceleration
